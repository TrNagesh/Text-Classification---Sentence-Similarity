 In the biomedical domain, progress has been

outstanding (2), producing reliable text-mining tools and

innovative text-processing algorithms. The combination of

these techniques has been increasingly applied to assist bio-

curators, allowing the extraction of biomedical concepts

such as genes, proteins, chemical compounds or diseases,

and thus reducing curation times and cost (3). Natural Language Processing (NLP)

techniques (4) are commonly applied as pre-processing

tasks to split documents’ text into meaningful components,

such as sentences and tokens, assign grammatical catego-

ries (a process named part-of-speech tagging), or even

apply linguistic parsing to identify the structure of each

sentence. Next, concept recognition methods are em-

ployed, which involve Named Entity Recognition (NER)

(5) to detect the concept mentions, and normalization or

disambiguation processes (6) to attribute unique identifiers

to each detected entity name. The study of these associations has generated

much interest, especially in relation to protein–protein

interactions (8), drug–drug interactions (9) and relations

between chemicals and target genes (10). Brat (11), MyMiner (12), Argo

(13) and Egas (14) are state-of-the-art interactive solutions,

aiming to simplify the annotation process. Nonetheless, these efforts are still hindered by a lack of

standardised ways to process the vast amount of data gen-

erated (15). The pipeline developed

provides interoperable interfaces for the integration of mis-

cellaneous annotated data, enabling the full exploitation of

curated knowledge according to World Wide Web

Consortium (W3C) standards. An evaluation study is pre-

sented regarding Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)

disease dataset, showing the integration of two distinct

text-mined results into a reusable and searchable know-

ledge base (available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/dmd/sca
